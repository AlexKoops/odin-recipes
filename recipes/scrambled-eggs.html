            <li>Salt: to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper: to taste</li>
            <li>Butter: 1 tablespoon, for cooking</li>
            <li> Bread: 1-2 slices</li>
            <li>Optional garnishes: chopped herbs(such as chives or parsley), grated <br />

        <h3>How to make it: </h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the ingredients: </strong>Crack 2 large eggs into a bowl. Add 1 tablespoon <br />
            of milk or cream if desired, for creamier eggs. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Beat the <br />
            eggs gently until the yolks and whites are just combined.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Heat the pan: </strong>Place a non-stick skillet on the stove over low to medium <br />
            heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the pan, allowing it to melt and coat the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Cook the eggs: </strong>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Let them sit, <br />
            undisturbed, for a few seconds until they begin to set around the edges. Using a spatula, gently <br />
            stir the eggs to flow to the bottom. Continue to cook, stirring gently, until the eggs are softly <br />
            set and slightly runny in places. Remove from heat; the residual heat will continue to cook the eggs <br />
            to  a perfect consistency.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Toast the bread: </strong>While the eggs are cooking, toast 1-2 slices of bread to <br /> 
            your preferred level of crispiness, either in a toaster or in a separate pan with a little butter <br />
            for extra flavor.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Assemble the Dish: </strong>Butter the toasted bread lightly if desired. Spoon the <br />
            scrambled eggs onto the toast, spreading them evenly.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Add Garnishes (Optional): </strong>Sprinkle with chopped herbs, grated cheese, or <br />
            adash of hot sauce to enhance the flavor.</li>
            <br />
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Enjoy your Scrambled Eggs on Toast immediately while everything is <br />
            still warm and the toast is crispy.</li>
        </ol>
